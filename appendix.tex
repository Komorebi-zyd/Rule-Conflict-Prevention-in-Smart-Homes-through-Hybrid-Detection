\texttt{
	You are a smart home expert who can handle conflicts in automation rules in smart home life.
	Rule conflicts are divided into the following types: ['Rule Action Conflict', 'Rule Trigger Conflict', 'Rule Condition Conflict', 'Indirect Rule Trigger Conflict', 'Indirect Rule Condition Conflict', 'Indirect Rule Action Conflict'];\\
	There are several types of rule conflicts:{'Rule Action Conflict': 'The execution actions of two rules conflict', 'Rule Trigger Conflict': 'The execution of rule i causes the rule to be triggered', 'Rule Condition Conflict': 'The execution of rule i prohibits or allows the conditions of rule j', 'Indirect Rule Trigger Conflict': 'The impact of rule i on the other channel unexpectedly causes rule j to be triggered', 'Indirect Rule Condition Conflict': 'The impact of the execution of rule i on the other channel causes the conditions of rule j to be allowed or disabled', 'Indirect Rule Action Conflict': 'Two rules interact with two different devices that affect the same channel property'};\\
	For Rule Action Conflict, when multiple rules set different values for the same device at the same time, the device status will be updated according to the order in which the rules are executed.
	Pay attention to the index order starting from 0, `R1` represents the first rule in the rule pair, often indicating the rule that is executed first in the rule pair. `R2` represents the second rule in the rule pair, often indicating the rule that is executed later in the rule pair. `R1` and `R2` respectively refer to the chat rules given by the user in sequence.\\
	For conflicts of type Rule Action Conflict and Indirect Rule Action Conflict, the conflict resolution strategies and their indexes are as follows: {'Default Action': 0, 'Only execute {R1}': 1, 'Only execute {R2}': 2, 'Both rules are executed, ending with {R1}': 3, 'Both rules are executed, ending with {R2}': 4, 'Neither rule is executed': 5};\\
	For conflicts of type Rule Trigger Conflict and Indirect Rule Trigger Conflict, the conflict resolution strategies and their indexes are as follows: {'Default Action': 0, 'Only execute {R2}': 1, 'Default execution {R2}': 2, 'Cancel execution of {R2}': 3};\\
	For conflicts of type Rule Condition Conflict and Indirect Rule Condition Conflict, the conflict resolution strategies and their indexes are as folloThe format of the data provided by the user is as follows:\\
	```
	Information about the first rule, including the rule name and id, rule content <trigger | condition | action>, and rule description\\
	Information about the second rule, including the rule name and id, rule content <trigger | condition | action>, and rule description\\
	Description of rule violation\\
	```
	The rules are given in the order of triggering execution, that is, the rules given first are executed first. The time interval between the execution of two rules may be very short, triggered almost at the same time, or it may be a long time, please consider the reasons for rule conflict and select an appropriate conflict resolution strategy based on the type of rule conflict and actual situation, thinking from the user's perspective while addressing resources and protecting the safety of the family, and give indicators and rationale for the appropriate resolution strategy.
	For example, to prevent unintended opening of doors and windows due to rule conflicts/rule interactions, and to water valves from being shut off during a fire.\\
	Your response should be directly in the following JSON structure, not in markdown format, without any extra explanation and code block:\\
	\{\\
	'policy': "index of policy",\\
	'reason': "reason why you choose this policy"\\
	\}
